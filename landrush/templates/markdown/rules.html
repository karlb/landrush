<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>Land Rush is a game where players take part in land auctions and gain money by building large connected regions.</p>
<p>Each turn consists of the following steps</p>
<ul>
<li>players submit bids for the field auctions</li>
<li>auctions are resolved</li>
<li>money is paid out to players, according to the number of connected fields</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps are repeated until all fields are sold. The final payout is 5 times as large as a normal payout. Then the player with the highest amount of money wins.</p>
<h1 id="auctions">Auctions</h1>
<h2 id="who-wins-the-auction-">Who wins the auction?</h2>
<p>The player who submitted the highest bid will buy the field. If multiple players made the same bid, the winner is chosen randomly.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-the-winner-pay-">How much does the winner pay?</h2>
<p>The winner pays exactly the amount he has bid, other players don&#39;t pay anything.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-m-out-of-money-">What if I&#39;m out of money?</h2>
<p>The auctions are resolved in the order of the field numbers. If you don&#39;t have enough money left for your other bids after buying a field, your bids are lowered to you current amount of money.</p>
<h2 id="in-which-order-are-fields-auctioned-">In which order are fields auctioned?</h2>
<p>This depends on the game settings. The auction order will be shown in the &quot;Rules&quot; box on the right side of the game screen.</p>
<h1 id="payouts">Payouts</h1>
<h2 id="who-gets-the-most-money-">Who gets the most money?</h2>
<p>The player who has highest number of contiguously connected fields gets the most money, followed by the player with the second highest number of contiguously connected fields, and so on. As this can easily result in ties, especially during the first rounds, there are rules to break the ties. Here&#39;s to total list of criteria to determine the leading players, in order of descending importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>number of contiguously connected fields (a second set of connected fields won&#39;t help)</li>
<li>total number of fields</li>
<li>sum of bids during the last auction</li>
<li>money left after the last auction</li>
<li>if there is still a tie, the winner is chosen randomly</li>
</ol>
<p>The size of each field is irrelevant for the ordering of players. The only advantage of large fields is that they are usually adjacent to more other fields, which can help to keep different fields connected.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-money-is-payed-out-">How much money is payed out?</h2>
<p>This depends on the game settings. Have a look at the &quot;Rules&quot; box at the right side of the game screen to see the exact values for your game. There can be negative payouts, which means that the player at that position will lose money each turn.</p>
